    "\n",
    "My name is [Katarzyna Kedzierska](https://kzkedzierska.github.io/), and this is my first time teaching Python. I have some experiance in teaching: I gave an ATAC-seq analysis course and lead some R classes, so not a total novice! I'm a DPhil student in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford. I'm what one might call a computational biologist and after spending few years in the lab I treated pipetting for debugging code and cleaning datasets ;). \n",

    "Hope you'll enjoy this workshop. If you have any questions ask me straight away, or shoot me [an email](mailto:kasia@well.ox.ac.uk) later on."

    "### Python advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Easy to read, easy to learn.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you write in Python resembles instructions you would give to someone (here: computer) in English. Behind the curtain the code is automatically converted to a set of instructions your computer understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Vast repository of libraries providing necessary extensions.__\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the comic above - if you need sth, there's probably a package in Python with the tools you need. Just import it `import some_package` and you're good to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Portable throughout platforms.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided that the code is run with the same version - it should run exactly the same on Linux, Widnows or Mac machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "__4. It's easy to leverage other languages speed (such as C/C++ or others) by combining it with Python code.__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still some moments where Python is not as quick as we would need it to be. But, it's super easy to implement C for example. According to Python Manual _It is quite easy to add new built-in modules to Python, if you know how to program in C. Such extension modules can do two things that canâ€™t be done directly in Python: they can implement new built-in object types, and they can call C library functions and system calls._ (you can read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/extending/extending.html)). But even if you do not know how to write in C you still can benefit from its speed by using [Cython](https://cython.org/) - you have to slightly adjust your code (for one, define variable types) and run Cython extension which will translate as much as it can to C. Et voila!\n",
    "\n",
    "__5. Python is object-oriented.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python is an object which helps in solving complex problems. At the beginning it might be a bit hard to wrap your head around this, but don't worry - it gets easier!"

The idea of this workshop is to show you how things are done in Python, how to load the tools and learn to use them, but mostly give you a flavor of Python's possibilities and show you where to find help. \n",
