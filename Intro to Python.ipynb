    "\n",
    "My name is [Katarzyna Kedzierska](https://kzkedzierska.github.io/), and this is my first time teaching Python, however I gave an ATAC-seq analysis course and lead some R classes, so not a total novice! I'm a DPhil student in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford. I'm what one might call a computational biologist and after spending few years in the lab I treated pipetting for debugging code and cleaning datasets ;). \n",

    "\n",
    "__1. Easy to read, easy to learn.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you write in Python resembles instructions you would give to someone (here: computer) in English. Behind the curtain the code is automatically converted to a set of instructions your computer understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Vast repository of libraries providing necessary extensions.__\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the comic above - if you need sth, there's probably a package in Python with the tools you need. Just import it `import some_package` and you're good to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Portable throughout platforms.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided that the code is run with the same version - it should run exactly the same on Linux, Widnows or Mac machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "__4. It's easy to leverage other languages speed (such as C/C++ or others) by combining it with Python code.__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still some moments where Python is not as quick as we would need it to be. But, it's super easy to implement C for example. According to Python Manual _It is quite easy to add new built-in modules to Python, if you know how to program in C. Such extension modules can do two things that can’t be done directly in Python: they can implement new built-in object types, and they can call C library functions and system calls._ (you can read more [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/extending/extending.html)). But even if you do not know how to write in C you still can benefit from its speed by using [Cython](https://cython.org/) - you have to slightly adjust your code (for one, define variable types) and run Cython extension which will translate as much as it can to C. Et voila!\n",
    "\n",
    "__5. Python is object-oriented.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python is an object which helps in solving complex problems. At the beginning it might be a bit hard to wrap your head around this, but don't worry - it gets easier!"
